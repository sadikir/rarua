                                                            <p>Our nations have been enslaved to debt and poverty that they see no escape route. We are richly endowed with natural resources but we have not been given a chance to enjoy what is our own. It is our time to open our mouth and start feeding. We have enough oh our people, we have enough that our nations would be struck with obesity due to overeating, but we are the ones hit by mulnutrition. We have countless young men able to plant seeds and look after our live stock or work in our factories. We have enough. The black man is suffering today because we've had leaders who are thirsty for instant gratification and dishonest gains. They want to change Africa in an overnight. They want to intertain their voters with quick results. They get quick debts to build roads, school and hospitals so fast to entice their voters, they forget that they are putting the nations in debts.</p>
                                                            <p>The land of a black man is a fresh uncultivated fertile land. When our leaders seek to harvest what they never planted, they enslave us to debt. Black man's land need leaders with long term african visions. Visions which are realistic enough not to leave anyone behind. We don't need debt to develop our nations, we don't need foreign manpower to develop our roads. All we need is knowing that the land is our own and we should develop it according to  our current wisdom. There is a reason black man's land seem to be left behind other nations. We should experience the joy of building our own nations from scratch. Africa is our own and will always be ours. Let's not compete with nations when in fact we are a different people who view the world differently.</p>
                                                            <p>We are advocating for a system of free trade, local production and consumption, promoting locally produced goods and products over foreign ones. You don't know how much fraud is involved in these goods.</p>
                                                            <p>Governement should promote locally owned businesses and make it easier for businesses to be started and operated. Government seeking instant gratification should be eliminated, those who hire foreign companies to provide manpower instead of our own people should be cut off. Our land should be built by our own people no matter how long it takes. We should teach our own capable men and women to provide skills to our nations.</p>

                                                            <p>Our land should be built to be self-sustaibable and able to play at the world market. It may sound too late to some but this is the right time to change. Time of change is now. We have so many youth capable of service and filled with passion that with a united spirit we can change our land in no time. We will not continue to be beggars when we have everything the world is begging to have.</p>
                                                            <p>We should be the ones other nations are asking help from. It is a shame. We need to serve and work hard so our sons and daughters will not beg as our fathers did. We have enough my people, we are rich my people. Lets accept our value my people. We can manage our immence riches, we can do it. There is nothing we don't have. We have all the fertile soils, favourable weather and enough deposit of mineral resources. Above all, we have capable youth unoccupied with nothing at all. We only need to wake up and have better management.</p>
                                                            <p>Lets wake up my people. I am so tired seeing my people being the despised ones who take everything thrown at them in exchange for their glory. We are glorious people who were endowed with so much. Let not small stresses of life hinder us from developing our lands. Lets use this desperate moment we are in for something good. We should not lament or be heartbroken by our current situation. We are masters of our destiny. It is time for change my people. We can all do it at the same time. This is an african revolution leaving no one behind.</p>
                                                            <p>It brings us tears tears to see our mothers struggling with basic things like giving birth and our fathers losing their minds over small issues like feeding their young. It is sad. We are capable Oh! Africa, we are capable. African youth stand up. Wake up and walk, walk to freedom and properity. You've been asleep for a long time, its your time to bring pride to future generations. Lets not use our youth for something worthless. Lets work to bring bride to our nations.</p>
                                                            <p>Rarua revolution is a movement seeeking to change Africa for all time. We seek to change africa financially by making it self-sustainable and independent. Join like minded people who want to leave an impact in Africa.</p>
