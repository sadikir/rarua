We've come to understand that democracy is the biggest form of deception told to our people. Real and capable leaders are enthroned by our maker and not people themselves. We need a king everyone will hapily work with. We all need a royal family everyone will entrust our leadership position. Kingdoms will reduce political tension and free our people from the lies and false hopes given birth by democracy.</p>
                                                            <p>We've observed that democratic leaders lack direction unlike a King who serve with unwavering focus. Kings serve with passion and sees everyone as his own. The pride of having a fortified kingdom if far greater than the headache experienced under the curruption of democracy. A wise and capable royal family means an endlessly strong nation. While a wise democracy only means a good 5 years term. We need kingship!</p>
                                                            <p>Let our leaders serve without worry about maintaining power. Democratic leaders only serve to see that they will win next term. They are only serving for themselves while the king serve tirelessly to give pride to the whole nation. He is not worried about competition with the opposion or anyone else.</p>
                                                            <p>We have to be lead by a royal family lead by God and governed by a unified political philosophy. Nations divided by political ideas find it hard to progress.</p>

                                                            <h3>Developed nations are not democratic but communist.</h3>
                                                            <p>The countries which you see around you that seem to be highly democratic are actually putting foward a false pretence. These nations are far worse than the foolish democratic games going on in Africa. Communist countries is what these nations are.</p>
                                                            <p>Every citizen of these nations is part of a sophisticated system of mental slavery where thoughts and actions are controlled.They are like computer programs following the instructions of their owners. All they do is like an act, a false pretence. They act democratic but the level of disenfranchisement going on in these countries are highly immense. Their next president has been preselected about 100 years ago.<p>
                                                            <p>In USA for example, the president is pre-selected even before he knows he will be president. The sorcery and dark magic involved in USA shadow government is something a common man would not undertand. Baalism that is going on int the west is something that many people don't know. The government is owned by very secret criminal dark forces that manipulates those bodies they present to you as presidential candidates. These forces control the government, the music industry and all other entertainment. They control the financial sector and all technology we use today. Struggle to change the society is like a war  with these corrupt wicked forces. These forces have taken over every human they could through the use of sophisticated electro-spiritual weaponry. They created social-media to destruct and destroy the masses electro-spiritually. They are in all walks of life, we work with them, we go to school with them yet they are nothing but agents who don't really know who they are. They are being used by the dark forces as spiritual portals for survaillance and launching phycho-spiritual attacks. They are humans considered half dead or without whole spirits, humans undergoing mass mind control to serve the government unknowingly. They are spiritual slaves of the shadow government. They are everywhere, they are nurses, police, homeless, celebrities and spread everywhere. They speak and act instictively without knowledge of what they are doing. The society is broken because of these agents of evil. Baal in skin, corrupted humans out there to spy on awakened humans and attack them phycho-spiritually.</p>
                                                            <h3>A world led by humans.</h3>
                                                            <p>We don't need to follow what these unconscious beings do, we don't! that's why we all need to work together and undo the damage caused by these beings. We need to wake them up. Otherwise the world will continue getting corrupt day by day. That's why we think independently and seek to create our own standards. Stop following the lead of stupid and unwise people who are spiritually non-existent. Humans should lead humans, and humans should create standards for humans.</p>
                                                            <p>One may urgue that the west is democratic and they've gone foward but infact these beings are demon-cratic. They are all connected like leaves on a big tree and all do the desires of the cabal. They are communists. A true definition of a communist state is that which everything and the people are government's property. People are tools of survillance unknowingly. Everyone is police. Everyone is millitary without a uniform. The shadow government sees what the people see. They carry no guns or wear a uniform but only their presence and acts of pretence are a great military victories. They are present to give the matrix life. They are like a body of the cabal, a body he uses to further his agenda. There is demon-cracy and communism in the west.</p>
                                                            <p>They desire other nations to be disunited in spirit. That's why they sold to us the idea of democracy yet in their nations, there has been one leader for all times, the dark force of evil, unseen yet ever present in the corrupt beings and their recently built machines. Democracy doesn't work for us. It keeps us repeating the same mistakes over and over again. It keeps our leaders concerned about how to keep power rather than serving the nation. Democracy is an idea infiltrated into our political system to keep us fighting over minor issues. We are setting up a kingdom and our make will bless us.</p>
